# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a tic tac toe game that can be played by two users. Each user is randomly assigned 'X' and 'O'. 
The user enters coordinates of the position.
After each turn the board is printed.

The coordinates are listed as -

(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

This is how the board looks at the start -

---------
|       |
|       |
|       |
---------

The user is prompted to enter the coordinates. 

Messages are displayed if -
-"This cell is occupied! Choose another one!" - if the cell is not empty;
-"You should enter numbers!" - if the user enters other symbols;
-"Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!" - if the user goes beyond the field.

Have fun playing!!!
